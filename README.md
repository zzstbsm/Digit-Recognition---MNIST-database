Simple neural network for digits recognition, in particular I used the MNIST database as training data set.
The library consist in 2 files:
- network_basic.py is the most basic implementation of the network without considering strategies to improve the learning speed, accuracy, etc.
- network_improved.py consist in the same code as the previous file, but there are some techniques applied (cross entropy cost function, different initialization, regularization, etc.)
